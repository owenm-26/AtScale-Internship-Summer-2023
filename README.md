# AtScale-Internship-Summer-2023
In this repository are all of the demos I created over the summer at AtScale with Andrew Rodriguez, another intern, that linked AtScale's Python API endings (AI LINK) to popular cloud services like
- Snowflake's Snowpark
- Databricks

## Purpose
These demos were created to onboard the marketing team on how the product integrates as well as act as a resource to show customers interested in the integrations possible with AtScale's AI Link 

## Takeaway
Over the course of the summer I gained the following from these projects and my teammate Andrew:
- Exposure to working with Snowflake and Databricks (worker node allocation)
- In-Depth practice with Python, PySpark, and SQL
- Practice with webhooks
- Learning from documentation on a product few are proficient in
- A proficiency using Git and Jira within a team environment
- Several opportunities to hone by skills in pandas and related libraries
- An introduction to different ML techniques and libraries, ranging from XGBoost to LightGBM
- A deep understanding and thorough practice in Jupyter notebooks

### Thank you's
To Gaurav Rau, my overarching mentor throughout the internship who helped design an internship experience that would allow me to learn more about what I am interested in.

To Jeff Curran, my tech lead who was understanding to my very rough first PRs and guided me through the process of working with a team in an enterprise software company.
